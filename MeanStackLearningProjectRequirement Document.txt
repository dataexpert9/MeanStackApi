This is documentation of MEAN Stack learning project.
It would be a blogs website with user authentication.

User could explore the website only after login and signup.

Each blog would belong to a particular user.
Each blog would have likes comments.

User would have the option to make their blogs private public.

Later on in future we will also provide groups feature.
